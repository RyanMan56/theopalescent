            <p><i>Always believe in yourself.</i></p>
            <p>
              Some days we just lie under my blankets,<br />
              watching stupid YouTube videos on a tiny tv screen.<br />
              She’s surprised I’ve never seen any Studio Ghibli films,<br />
              and we end up watching one after the other;<br />
              Totoro, Howl, Spirited, Mononoke.
            </p>
            <p><i>Do this and no matter where you are,</i></p>
            <p>
              She gets excited as she talks about the films.<br />
              Animation fascinates her, but she is insecure about it,<br />
              feeling as if it dims her maturity. I always assure her<br />
              that her enthusiasm, the way she waves her hands,<br />
              smiling as she tells me facts about Hayao Miyazaki<br />
              while a documentary of his work plays in the background,<br />
              is what makes her. I tell her I love to hear her talk<br />
              about the things she loves, that if passion makes you<br />
              immature, we should all be children forever;<br />
              buried under quilts and Disney blankets, hands kept warm<br />
              by hot drinks in cartoon mugs from my kitchen.

            <p>
              There are places in the world so dry<br />
              we can be tricked into believing nothing will grow.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the deserts of Peru, plants hold<br />
              their breath beneath this cracked belt of earth
            </p>
            <p>
              so quiet we might think they have died<br />
              under the lash. But they know fog will soften the leather
            </p>
            <p>
              and when it rolls by in winter, they poke<br />
              through the crust and the holes where the brass clasp
            </p>
            <p>
              would keep in the belly of them<br />
              but no more. When we see what they become
            </p>
            <p>
              each flower-bud, each stem<br />
              it is hard to believe they weren’t like this before.
